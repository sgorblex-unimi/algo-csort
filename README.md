# algo-csort
This repo contains a C implementation of some basic sorting algorithms, with the purpose of both studying the theory and practicing for the lab exam of the course of Algorithms and Data Structures at Universit√† Statale di Milano (which I attended on academic year 2020/2021).

Despite being out of the scope of the course, I challenged myself with some more advanced C concepts, namely function pointers and managing generic data types (which is done via void pointers). This challenge continued in part of the [algolab](https://github.com/sgorblex-unimi/algolab) repository.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for undone parts.
